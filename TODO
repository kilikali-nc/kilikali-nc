Before release
--------------

- code: add common global string buffers like tmp_str:s instead of _tmp.
- code: investigate is it possible to get rid off g_timeout_add() calls
- code: check tabs/spaces
- config: at least print some error, if invalid lines in config while parsing.
  now just quits with error 3.
- errors: check is there enought checks + messages
- filebrowser: fix bug where sometimes "file added" userinfo isn't printed for
  single files
- filebrowser: search - search lost at update (u) and dir change.
- filebrowser: enter adds item to playlist and starts playing it
- filebrowser: Update filebrowser list if changed when going into filebrowser
  mode
- filebrowser: search - use new search with regex
  + probably not needed anymore: fix use of non-UTF8 isupper() in filebrowser
- keybindings: check default values
- man page: check content
- playlist: fix search next (n-key) (atm moves to some non-matching items)
  + check if still happens
- search: does noh really reset search? In vim it set highlightmode off until
  next search
- search/cmdline: optional history file
- search/cmdline history: sometimes (null) appears appears to end of line
- translations: needs string check and proper translations
- translations: check that works properly

Future
------

- code: character encoding, iconv to encode printable strings + config (idea probably
  is to use same encoding than terminal)
- command: replace - clear playlist + add path/file/playlist
- command: set - to configuration modification. + way to save configuration
- mouse: add seek, possibly volume and selections
- playlist: some easy way to change between multiple playlists (like vim buffers?)
- search/cmdline: fix remaining bugs from tabulator completition
