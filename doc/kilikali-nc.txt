DESCRIPTION
  kilikali-nc is an NCurses based audio player. It supports a variety of
  file formats. kilikali-nc also reads PLS (read and write) and M3U (read only)
  playlists.

  The kilikali-nc UI has taken infuences from Vim and the way graphical file
  managers handle files. In modal style of Vim, the application has several
  main modes: Playlist, Edit, Command, Search and Filebrowser.

  Commands' left over parameters are handled as file(s), directorie(s), url(s)
  and playlist(s) which are tried to add to the end of the default playlist.

OPTIONS
  -h             Print help.
  -g [new_conf]  Generate default configuration file. Overrides an existing file of the same name.
  -c [old_conf]  Set external configuration file. Use this file to read config.
  -l [log_file]  Set logfile path. Logs to this file.
  -k             User can check input combinations to configure keys. Escape to exit.
  -d             Log debug information.

CONFIG
  By default kilikali-nc looks for a configuration file under the path
  ~/.config/kilikali-nc/default.cfg. A different configuration file may be
  used with the -c option. A new configuration file with all the default
  options can be generated using the -g option.

  Most Playlist and Edit mode keys can be changed using config file.

  See default or a newly generated config file for syntax and examples.
